		or

					Part 2
******************************************************************************************
Part A:

	If you want this code to work on your computer, you would have to change some things. 
	Change any FileReader fr = new FileReader("/Users/christinabui/Desktop/ctbui_Assignment2/Part2/bookGuten/guten"+a+".txt"); to the directory that the ctbui_Assignment2 file is located at. I recommend putting it on your desktop and just changing "christinabui" to your home directory name.(Applies on line 47, 186, 218)
	
	
	You would also need to run the book.sh file (in a file called bookGuten) to download all the book files. (This is mainly for the Professor, these files should be included in gitHub)
		bash book.sh

	Compile & Run
		javac PartA.java
		java PartA
******************************************************************************************
Part B:

	The same rules apply that we did with Part A (Changing FileReader fr = new Reader(...) pathway. This would only apply on line 54.

	If you have not downloaded the book files in a folder "bookGuten" please do so as stated in PartA.

	Compile & Run
		javac PartB.java
		java PartB
