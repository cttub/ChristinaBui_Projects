About:

My past job, I use to work as a Receptionist at Marvelous Nails. It was hard to organize customer service along with checking people out with their final purchases. This is a personal project to better implement: 
			Customer Check-In/Check-Out
			Customer Wait Time
			Purchases
			Technician Order
			Technician Wait-Time

I do not plan on using this project outside of just a personal project to build my Java skills. But if there is any opportunity to grow this project, I would be open to any ideas.
