Initialize boolean to guess variable
Initialize User Input to userInput
Initialize variable to initialGuess
Initialize a variable in which to store number of guesses to attempts
Initialize Scanner object
Promjpt User to chose number
Set variable for initialGuess And store it by ty taking the high variable and dividing it by two
Increment attempts in the variable storing number by
Present guess to User with initialGuess
Present prompt to user
User Scanner to grab next int
If User type 1 change boolean variable to true and skip loop and prompts user with their number
If user types 3 solve for new low variable by adding guess by one
Indicares flaw in User Input
Subtract Highest Variable by low variable
Take Difference of that and Divide it by 2
Take Highest variable and subtact from the quotient
Print out attempts
